# Introduction

The Fitness Tracker is a simple Mongoose Datbase Application, meant to track your excercises performed daily. It records both rep based and cardio based exercises through a simple form, from which you can then track your progress on the color coded dashboard!

# Development

This application focuses primarily on the use of MongoDB:
1. Primarily, we have the use of the initialization of the workout model, which utilizes similar format to that of MySQL, yet it has a slightly different syntax.
2. This application also utilizes Express to handle routing and Node Morgan Module to log out the requests made from the routes, for easy tracking on a local device.
